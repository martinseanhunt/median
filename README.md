Median is my Redux project submission for Udacities React Nanodegree program and a love letter to Medium.com

## Installation

1. Clone the api server from https://github.com/martinseanhunt/median-api.git

**Note: THis is important as I've made some slight modifications to the standard readable api server.** 

2. CD in to the api server directory and run 

### npm install
### npm start

3. Clone this repository. 

4. Cd in to the median directory and run 

### npm install
### npm start

A working demo is available, running on now, at https://median-kindpxoesr.now.sh**

**Note: Don't forget to try holding down the vote button and higlighting some text when posting / editing :)**
